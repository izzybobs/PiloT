The PiloT is a Raspberry Pi \(RPi\) HAT compliant board.

The PiloT power state is controlled via the Rpi GPIO and the Pilot is powered via the RPi 40 pin header.

Control and data communications between the PiloT with the RPi is via USB or the RPi physical serial port.

Note that some RPi variants use the physical serial port to communicate with the RPi on board WiFi / Bluetooth module
